           Hi Everyone,
            </p>
            <p>
            So you may have noticed the big banner on our website and thought: "What the hell?". I'd like to explain why we're doing this. </p><p>
            As you may know, vis.js is developed at Almende BV in the Netherlands. Almende has a number of daughter companies, among which: <a href="http://dobots.nl" target="_blank">DoBots</a>.
                They share our building and we're working with them a lot! We have used their code and hardware in projects and have contributed some code for the
                firmware as well.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/blog/kickstarter_1.png" style="position:relative; left:12px; padding:10px;">
            <p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dobots/crownstone">DoBots is now doing a kickstarter for the Crownstone, a smart upgrade for any power socket!</a> Recently I have spend a few weeks helping them settings up their campaign. I made the video's,
                the 3D artwork and helped out with the texts. I think this is a great product and I believe it deserves a chance to enter the market!</p>
            <img src="./images/blog/kickstarter_2.png" style="position:relative; left:12px; padding:10px;">
            <p>Like us (the vis.js team), the guys at DoBots believe in open source. The Crownstone's Bluetooth API's will be open but secure so only YOU can use YOUR Crownstones. This means you can use any BLE device to interact with your house!
            If the stretchgoal is made, there'll even be Arduino support! I will also be working on the iOS app and that too will be open source.</p>
            <p>I hope our community can help <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dobots/crownstone">the kickstarter</a> reach it's goal and maybe even the stretchgoals.</p>
            <img src="./images/blog/kickstarter_3.png" style="position:relative; left:12px; padding:10px;">
            <p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dobots/crownstone">Please support us and spread the word!</a></p><p>If you share it in a tweet, facebook or different way, <a href="https://github.com/almende/vis/issues/1302">leave a comment in issue #1302! :)</a></p>
            <p>Regards and thank you,</p>

        <div class="postHeader" id="V4Release">V4, ES6 and what's next</div>
        <div class="postAuthor">by <a href="https://github.com/alexdm0">Alex</a></div>
        <div class="postDate">22nd of May 2015</div>
        <div class="postContent">
            <p>
                It’s been a long time coming but its finally here! We have just released the newest version of vis.js:
                v4! This is a breaking release (hence the version number change). This means the options and the API
                have been changed in such a way that it is no longer backwards compatible.
            </p>

            <p>
                We know it is annoying to go back to your code and making the required changes, but I guarantee that it
                is for the best. To help with this migration, we have included an option validator to our new release.
                This validator is currently applied on the network, timeline and graph2d. It checks if the options you
                supply are of the right type. If your options do not exist or if the type is wrong, it will give
                you an understandable message with suggestions of options you may have meant. We think this will make
                developing for vis a lot easier, as well as the migration from v3 to v4.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest change in this release is in the network module. We have rewritten the network module in
                full and the results are cleanly separated ES6 modules. The option structure has been changed to suit
                this structure. The options have also been grouped, making it easier to document and understand. For example,
                lets look at the options for fonts. It used to be fontColor, fontFace fontSize, which is now
                grouped in a font object with {color:’’,face:’’,size:’’}. Also completely new is the clustering
                mechanism. It used to be mostly automatic and twitchy but this new version gives all the control to the
                user. This should make the clustering very useful and I’ll be happy to hear of missing features for
                this!
            </p>

            <p>
                We have moved to hammer.js 2 for all of our touch and click events, and a lot of work has gone into
                updating all the css elements (especially for timeline) to eliminate conflicts with large frameworks
                that overload <i>everything</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the last year, we have received a lot of issues on our Github page for which we are very thankful.
                Whether it is a bug report, question or feature request, we handle all of them as quickly as we can, and
                with these big new rewrites it gives us a new perspective on what is important. We hope the validator
                will prevent a lot of issues. The new examples have also been designed to more clearly show simple
                options. We plan to provide links to JSBin for all options, but this is a lot of work (for which we
                wouldn’t mind some help ;) ).
            </p>

            <p>
                So what’s next? Well the next module that really needs a good overhaul is the graph2d. This module is
                used by us internally quite a lot, and we need to improve the architecture and make it easy to extend it
                with new graph types.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to unify the code between the timeline and the graph2d even more. The ideal result would be
                using a graph2d as a group in the timeline, or use the timeline items in a graph2d without nasty hacks.
                The graph2d should get numeric x axis (so not necessarily only time), logarithmic axis and hopefully the
                architecture will be flexible enough to allow the x and y axis to be interchanged. The API across the
                modules will also be further unified, and I think we’ve made a great start with v4!
            </p>

            <p>
                From all the modules currently in vis, the graph3d is the oldest and currently the one suffering a lack
                of attention. If you are an excited user of the graph3d module and want to contribute, we’re open for
                additions to the vis.js team! The graph3d is feature complete but a webgl implementation could be a
                great improvement.
            </p>

            <p>
                I cannot give a timeframe for the things I have discussed here, and we’re always open for ideas and
                contributions. If you feel like you want to contribute, let us know :).
            </p>

            <h3>Changelog:</h3>

            <h4>General</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Changed the build scripts to include a transpilation of ES6 to ES5
                    (using <a href="http://babel.org">http://babel.org</a>), so we can use ES6 features in the vis.js
                    code.
                    When creating a custom bundle using browserify, one now needs to add a
                    transform step using <code>babelify</code>, this is described in README.md.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Timeline</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Integrated an option configurator and validator.</li>
                <li>Implemented option <code>multiselect</code>, which is false by default.</li>
                <li>Added method <code>setData({groups: groups, items: items})</code>.</li>
                <li>Fixed range items not being displayed smaller than 10 pixels (twice the
                    padding). In order to have overflowing text, one should now apply css style
                    <code>.vis.timeline .item.range { overflow: visible; }</code> instead of
                    <code>.vis.timeline .item.range .content { overflow: visible; }</code>.
                    See example 18_range_overflow.html.
                </li>
                <li>Fixed invalid css names for time axis grid, renamed hours class names from
                    <code>4-8h</code> to <code>h4-h8</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Deprecated option <code>showCustomTime</code>. Use method <code>addCustomTime()</code> instead.</li>

            <p>
                Today we released vis.js version 3.11.0. The Timeline has gotten quite some attention in this release:
                For example, the Timeline finally has gotten more event handlers to enable custom behavior in a flexible
                way. Network is evolving at a steady speed. It's really great to get more and more substantial
                contributions from the community latest months! Thanks.
            </p>

            <p>Changelog:</p>

            <h3>Network</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>(added gradient coloring for lines, but set for release in 4.0 due to required refactoring of
                    options).
                </li>
                <li>Fixed bug where a network that has frozen physics would resume redrawing after setData, setOptions
                    etc.
                </li>
                <li>Added option to bypass default groups. If more groups are specified in the nodes than there are in
                    the groups, loop over supplied groups instead of default.
                </li>
                <li>Added two new static smooth curves modes: curveCW and curve CCW.</li>
                <li>Added request redraw for certain internal processes to reduce number of draw calls (performance
                    improvements!).
                </li>
                <li>Added pull request for usage of Icons. Thanks @Dude9177!

                    DataView.
                </li>
                <li>Fixed #688: Added a css class to be able to distinguish buttons "Edit node" and "Edit edge".</li>

                </li>
                <li>Implemented creating new range items by dragging in an empty space with the
                    ctrl key down.
                </li>
                <li>Implemented configuration option `order: function` to define a custom ordering
                    for the items (see #538, #234).

                <li>Fixed #664: end of item not restored when canceling a move event.</li>
                <li>Fixed #609: reduce the left/right dragarea when an item range is very small,
                    so you can still move it as a whole.
                </li>
                <li>Fixed #676: misalignment of background items when using subgroups and the
                    group label's height is larger than the contents.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="postHeader" id="The 2015 roadmap for vis.js">The 2015 roadmap for vis.js</div>
        <div class="postAuthor">by <a href="https://github.com/AlexDM0">Alex</a></div>
        <div class="postDate">9th of January 2015</div>
        <div class="postContent">
            <p>
                I initially wanted to do a small recap of vis.js so far but it became larger (and more off topic) than I
                expected. To understand some of the motivations for our roadmap, <a href="#A look back on vis.js">take a
                look at the post below this one first</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                So now for our plans for 2015! We have added a lot of features over the last year, and we have to be
                careful that vis does not die of option-obesity. To mediate this we thought of a few solutions.
                Firstly, we will make the docs collapsible using a similar system to <a
                    href="https://www.jsoneditoronline.org/" target="_blank">Jos&prime;s great online JSON editor</a>.
                This is naturally a temporary fix but
                the docs are one of the most important ways to get information. We think we ourselves may be the most
                frequent visitor of those pages so it's a good start!
            </p>

            <p>
                Secondly, the actual changes, we plan to reorganize some of the option structure. This will
                unfortunately (but by definition) be a breaking change from our old versions. The new structure will be
                clearer and more intuitive. The work our current
                users will have to do to update will be minimal. If you're using the options we reorganize, you'll have
                to update your options. Breaking releases are always a shame, but we feel it is necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                The third step we want to take is to go over the code of each module and modularize everything much
                more. This will make the code easier to maintain as we move away from very large .js files, as well as
                make it easier to expand on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once everything is modularized, we want to change the API to allow users to plug their own parts of vis
                together. As an example: You start a network module, plug in the type of node module, edge module,
                physics module and optionally navigation module (etc.) and you're good to go!
                All of these modules will be individually configured. This means the huge list of options will be
                segmented into smaller, more manageable parts. Additionally, the docs will become smaller and clearer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, we do not want to abandon all our plug-and-play functionality! We will also start to supply
                more preconfigured constructors (i.e. a vis.BarChart that will give you a preconfigured graph2d module).
                Apart from these constructors
                we will continue to publish examples which will include code snippets that you can use in your own
                project.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once this has been completed, we expect there will be more options that accept functions as arguments
                which gives you more control over vis. Finally, because everything (well, more than now) would be split
                up into
                modules, it becomes easier for the community to create additional modules, further improving vis!
            </p>

            <p>
                The things I have listed here are the ideas that we have now. This is subject to change. We also cannot
                provide a timeline for this because we work on vis whenever we have time. No deadlines, no constrains,
                just when we have time.
            </p>

            <p>
                To wrap up, there are a few things I did not mention here but I'd like to add to the post anyway.
            <ul>
                <li>We want to improve the fusion of graph2d and the timeline, with the ideal that a graph2d can be used
                    like a group in timeline now.
                </li>
                <li>Examples will be split in simple option/configuration examples and larger, feature
                    demonstration/exploration examples.
                </li>
                <li>Graph2d will be expanded.</li>
                <li>We will move to hammer.js 2.0.</li>

                In April 2013, the initial commit was made for vis.js by <a href="https://github.com/josdejong">Jos</a>
                because the old CHAP LINKS library was becoming too large to expand and maintain.
                Vis.js was a clean, new start using all the knowledge gathered from the CHAP library with the ideal that
                the new infrastructure would be more stable, faster and easier to maintain.
            </p>

            <p>
                In January 2014, I joined the project and started to expand the Network module, which was called Graph
                back then. I have been working alongside Jos since then we have poured a lot of hours into vis.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the 16th of April 2014, exactly a year after the initial commit, <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/hackernewsbot/status/456231005678874624" target="_blank">a twitterbot with
                a lot of followers</a> notified
                the world that we were featured on hackernews! This was the boost we needed to really reach a large
                community. We saw the amount of visitors and Github stars increase greatly over the months that
                followed.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 14th of October, we have altered the license of vis.js to MIT or APACHE 2.0. This allowed <a
                    href="http://tiddlywiki.com/" target="_blank">Tiddlywiki</a> to add vis.js to their keychain. From
                what we hear,
                their developers really enjoy working with vis and we look forward to hearing how their community uses
                our software!
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, we have a great community that helps out in issues, fixes our typos in the docs, notifies us of
                bugs and sometimes fixes them for us. We have received pull requests with new features and improvements
                and
                it has been fantastic!
            </p>

            <p>
                This post started out as the roadmap for vis in 2015, but the review was longer than I initially
                expected thereby deserving its own post.
            </p>

            <p>
                Have fun using vis!

                The old website served us well, but now that we arrived in 2015... it is really time for an upgrade! We
                hope the new website is more informative, modern and a good promotion for vis.js!
                It also allows us to keep the community updated through this blog and to <a href="./showcase/index.html"
                                                                                            target="_blank">show off
                great projects that make use of vis.js in our showcase</a>.
            </p>

            <p>If you have made something and would like it featured,
                please make an <a href="https://github.com/almende/vis/issues" target="_blank">issue on Github</a> with
                your project and how you'd like to be credited.</p>
            </p><p>
            The new website is in beta so if anyone spots a typo or other mistake, please let us know on our <a
                href="https://www.github.com/almende/vis" target="_blank">Github</a> page.
        </p>

            <p>
                There is no forum on this website. We prefer to keep all the communication with the community through
                Github. We believe this is the best solution so everyone only has to check the Github issues
                when there is a problem or suggestion.
            </p>

            <p>
                A big change introduced with our new website, is the <a href="./featureRequests.html" target="_blank">feature
                request page</a>. There are a lot of issues on Github that suggest features but we do not
                always have time to implement these ourselves. On the other hand, there have been issues where people
                tell us they want to contribute but are now sure where to start. To mediate this (and to make a clear
                overview
                for ourselves) we listed everything <a href="./featureRequests.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Once a feature is added to <a href="./featureRequests.html" target="_blank">the list</a>, it is not the
                end of the line. At each new release, we'll look at the list and see which features we may want to pick
                up for the next one. Discussions on these features
                can still continue on the referenced Github issues. When we have added a feature to this list, we will
                close the Github issue that requested it to keep our open issues more of a bug-todo list. The main
                motivation for this
                is because we have noticed that old bugs (on pages after 2) would be overlooked from time to time.
            </p>

            <p>
                This feature page is an experiment. If it turns out that the community does not like us closing issues
                with open feature requests or if it does not have the impact we'd like it to have, we'll revert back to
                the old model.
            </p>

            <p>
                We thank you all for using vis! Last year has seen a great increase in our user base and it is a great
                motivating factor knowing that our work is used by others!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's to a great 2015!

            <p>
                We're proud to present a new version of the vis.js library: 3.8.0! This release has a lot of new
                features and bugfixes, nearly all of which were suggested and/or discovered
                by our community on <a href="https://www.github.com/almende/vis" target="_blank">Github</a>. A lot of
                the issues on Github have been handled in this release and it is likely to be the
                last release before 4.0.0. The 4.0.0 release will break compatibility with old code (only options will
                be revisited on the API side) but more on that in <a href="#The 2015 roadmap for vis.js">the roadmap
                post</a>.
